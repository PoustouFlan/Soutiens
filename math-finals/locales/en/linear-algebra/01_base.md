# Base

Is the family ((3, 3, 2), (2, 1, 1), (4, 1, 2)) a base of R<sup>3</sup>?

base ->   = 
    (=) Yes
    () No, then extract an independant family and complete it to obtain a base.

What are the coordinates of (1, 2, 3) in this base ?

coordonnees ->    =
    ()  a -> (5, -6, 19)
    (=) b -> (5, -19, 6)
    ()  c -> (-5, -19, 6)
    ()  d -> (-5, -6, 19)

Suppose X is a column matrix consisting of the coordinates of a vector in the standard basis, and X' is a column matrix consisting of the coordinates of the same vector in our new basis.
Compute the matrix A such that X'=AX.
