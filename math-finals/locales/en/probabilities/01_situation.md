# Situation

Suppose we have a playlist made of 3 songs, in a random order.
Our goal is to sort the playlist in alphabetical order. (We suppose it is not initially the case).
The only action allowed is hitting the "shuffle" button, which randomly shuffles the playlist (it can possibly not change the order).

# Distribution

Let X be the random variable associated with the number of shuffles before the playlist gets sorted.
Determine the distribution of X.

distribution -> What would be the value of P(X=3) ? =
    () a -> 1/36
    () b -> 1/72
    (=) c -> 25/216
    () d -> 25/72
    () e -> 125/216
